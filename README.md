# loop-studios


This page was my first attempt at building a website entirely with material UI. The sites works as expected but it isn't responsive on some screen sizes. I haven't learnt responsiveness yetðŸ˜¥ but my next project would surely be an improvement from this one. Really proud of my growth so far especially in reducing how much css i write.


The live site is here: https://loopstudiooos.netlify.app/
